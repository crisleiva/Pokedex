## Pokedex API

A Ruby on Rails backend api.
The api contains seeded data of all the original 151 Pokemon.

### Getting Started

Make sure you know how to install postgress. As this backend relies on it.
```ruby
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

After that just go back to the frontend:
